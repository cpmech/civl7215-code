1. Collect soft clay data
soil        cu = 20.0 kPa
soil gamma dry = 18.0 kN/m³
soil gamma wet = 19.0 kN/m³

2. Collect footing data and compute stress
area of the footing         = 4.0 m²
pressure at base of footing = 100.0 kN/m²
effective overburden stress = 18.0 kPa

3. Collect granular columns data
column diameter            = 0.8 m
column spacing             = 1.5 m
area replacement ratio a_s = 0.26

4. Compute bearing capacity of single granular column
qult (column) = 400.0 kPa

5. Compute bearing capacity of natural ground
shape factor sc = 1.2
shape factor dc = 1.1
qult (soil)     = 153.7 kPa

6. Compute bearing capacity of composite foundation
qult = 217.2 kPa

7. Check factor of safety
FS = 2.17
This design does not meet the bearing capacity requirement

8. Modify the design
new: qult_req           = 250.0 kPa
new: a_s (temp)         = 0.39
new: spacing (computed) = 1.22 m
new: spacing (selected) = 1.20 m
new: a_s                = 0.40
new: qult               = 253.0 kPa
new: FS                 = 2.53
OK
